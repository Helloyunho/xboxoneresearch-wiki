## Info
The ["Game Script" application](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pb1gw72nv4w) available on the Microsoft store allows writing and executing scripts in a custom language. This language exposes arbitrary memory read/write functionality, which can be used to achieve arbitrary native code execution.
