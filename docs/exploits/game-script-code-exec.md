## Info
The ["Game Script" application](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pb1gw72nv4w) available on the Microsoft store allows writing and executing scripts in a custom language. This language exposes arbitrary memory read/write functionality, which can be used to achieve arbitrary native code execution.

## Prerequisites
- [Game Script](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pb1gw72nv4w)

## Instructions
Launch Game Script and input the Proof-of-Concept found on [Github](https://gist.github.com/carrot-c4k3/10fdb4f3d11ca568f5452bbaefdc20dd).
